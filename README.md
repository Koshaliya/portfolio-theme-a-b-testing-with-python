# 🚀 Portfolio A/B Test: Light vs Dark Theme

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **real-world A/B test applied to my personal portfolio website**.  

Objective: Determine whether **Light or Dark theme** improves clicks on my "Get In Touch" section, which reveals email, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

---

## Experiment Design
- **Control (A):** Light theme default  
- **Treatment (B):** Dark theme default  
- **Random Assignment:** Visitors randomly assigned to one of two variants.  
- **Primary Metric:** Click-Through Rate (CTR)  

Hypothesis:
- **H0:** Theme has no impact on CTR  
- **H1:** Dark theme increases CTR

---

## Analysis
- Calculated required **sample sizes** for different Minimum Detectable Effects (MDEs)  
- Simulated A/B test results using **Z-test for proportions**  
- Estimated **confidence intervals**, effect size, and statistical significance  
- Measured business impact in recruiter engagement

---

## Results
| Metric | Control (Light) | Treatment (Dark) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| CTR | 8% | 10% |
| Relative Lift | - | 25% |
| Statistically Significant | - | ✅ |

**Conclusion:** Dark theme improves recruiter engagement. Deploying Dark theme as default is recommended.
